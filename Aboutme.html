      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 60px">
        Hello! My name is Tom Studley. I'm originally from Sydney's Inner West
        in Australia, now studying psychology at the Australian National
        University in Canberra. One of my favourite past-times is getting lost
        in the worlds of fantasy and sci-fi novels, movies and games. I have a
        deep appreciation for the immersive capability of computer graphics. It
        is my dream to be able to render fantastic, new worlds that others can
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2>My Passion</h2>
      <p class="bodylink">
        <a href="blender.org">Blender</a> is a 3D creative software that allows
        modelling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
        motion tracking, and much more. Blender is the go-to for beginners in 3D
        graphics. It serves as an all-purpose, artistic and professional design
        medium. It is also completely free, open source, and has a more flexible
        and beginner-friendly interface than comparable software.

        My website is designed specifically as a platform for learners and
        general users of Blender. Specifically, it is for those who want to
        discovering interesting elements and techniques that they can apply in
        their own projects, and perhaps also learn skills while doing so. Often
        learners are forced to scour through algorithms on YouTube or forums to
        find tutorials that explain each step thoroughly enough for their
        understanding. Furthermore, many of the well-known beginner-friendly
        tutorials are simply boring, as the end goal is to learn, rather than
        create something cool. I personally do not resonate with this approach,
        and I think that people are more likely to actively learn when they are
        fulfilling a goal that they find creatively stimulating.

        This website  contains a compilation ofhand-picked beginner-friendly tutorials where the objective is to
        encourage creativity. For example, you could spend 10 hours following an
        ad-filled, learner-focused tutorial course on creating a regular glazed
        donut, or you could spend a few hours creating this awesome wireframe
        donut, which you can immediately edit and play around with in your own
        scenes.

        Each postincludes my own description of the element, and an
        embedded link to the tutorial. In the same way that you might prefer
        listening to somebody elseâ€™s hand-picked music playlist rather than wade
        through popular music recommended by an algorithm, users might like my
        style and want to stick around. Unlike a Youtube playlist, I can
        communicate and discuss with viewers. This is found on the
        <a href="guide.html">Guidebook</a> page.

        I am also be displaying my own projects on the
        <a href="Artworks.html">Gallery</a> page. This is not only for my own
        display but also to present to viewers the kind of content they can
        expect in my guidebook.
